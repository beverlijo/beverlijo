- 👋 Hi, I’m @Beverli
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science, the command line, the basics of the basics (but not BASIC - that's too far back)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, at this point :)
- 📫 How to reach me hmmm...not sure I want to put that out there yet
